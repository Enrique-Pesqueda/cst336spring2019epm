                    Following the United States establishing Fort Yuma, two towns developed one mile downriver. The one on the 
                    California side was called Jaeger City, named after the owner of Jaeger's Ferry, which crossed the river there. 
                    It was for a time the larger of the two, with the Butterfield Overland Mail office and station, two blacksmiths, 
                    a hotel, two stores, and other dwellings.[8] The other was called Colorado City. Developed on the south side of 
                    the river in what is now Arizona by speculator Charles Poston, it was the site of the custom house. When started, 
                    it was just north of the border between Mexican-ruled Sonora, Mexico and California. After the Gadsden 
                    Purchase by the United States, the town bordered on the Territory of New Mexico. This area was designated as the 
                    Territory of Arizona in 1863. The Colorado City site at the time was duly registered in San Diego; both banks of 
                    the Colorado River just below its confluence with the Gila were recognized as being within the jurisdiction of 
                    California. The county of San Diego collected taxes from there for many years.[8][9]. From 1854, Colorado City was 
                    the major steamboat stop for traffic up and down the Colorado River. After the 1862 flood, it became part of 
                    Arizona City. The steamboats transported passengers and equipment for the various mines and military outposts 
                    along the Colorado; Colorado City was the terminus of wagon traffic up the Gila River into New Mexico Territory. 
                    They offloaded the cargo from ships at the mouth of the Colorado River at Robinson's Landing and from 1864 at 
                    Port Isabel. From 1864, the Yuma Quartermaster Depot, today a state historic park, supplied all forts in 
                    present-day Arizona, as well as large parts of Colorado and New Mexico. After Arizona became a separate 
                    territory, Yuma became the county seat for Yuma County in 1871, replacing La Paz, the first seat. The Southern 
                    Pacific Railroad bridged the river in 1877, and acquired George Alonzo Johnson's Colorado Steam Navigation Company, 
                    the only steamboat company on the river. Yuma became the new base of navigation on the river, ending the need for 
                    Port Isabel, which was abandoned in 1879. The warehouses and shipyard there were moved to Yuma.
                    This chapter first starts off with sexism in America after World War II and then talks about the Civil Rights 
                    Movement, and the role women had during this era which later developed into the Feminist Movement. After this, 
                    the book then decides to emphasize the unfair verdicts that were placed on minorities and the movement against the 
                    current prison system in America. This chapter then ends with the rise in Indian activism. In the 1920s women were 
                    granted the right to vote. However, even if they were granted suffrage, sexism in America was still a problem. 
                    This chapter also talks about the moments that disrupted sexism in America. During World War II, women were asked 
                    to work outside of their homes because many of the men were out fighting a war. Even though this disruption minimized 
                    the amount of sexism in the country, women still held no political power. During the Civil Rights Movement, women 
                    played a crucial role by demonstrating their fight for civil rights and being against the Vietnam war. This ultimately 
                    allowed the feminist movement to develop. The Feminist Movement was complex in terms of what they were against and 
                    made it clear that they protested against aggressive male domination and capitalism. One of the biggest problems 
                    faced by the Femisint Movement revolved around abortion and how society deemed it immoral and in some states illegal. 
                    Women protested for their right to control their own bodies and were able to legalize abortions after Roe V. Wade. 
                    The feminist movement also made it their goal to free society of the norms that allow people to believe that women 
                    should be gentle and yielding. This chapter also talks about the prison system in America, and how minorities are 
                    more likely to be arrested rather than the upper-class or white. After that, it then goes to talk about social 
                    activism done by Indians, which lead to the development of the National Indian Youth Council. The first important 
                    point in this chapter is about the disruption in sexism after World War II. During World War II many women had jobs
