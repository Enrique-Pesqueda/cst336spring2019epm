                    <h5>Ethical Hacking sometimes called as Penetration Testing is an act of<br/> 
                    intruding/penetrating into system or networks to find out threats, <br/>
                    vulnerabilities in those systems which a malicious attacker may find and <br/>
                    exploit causing loss of data, financial loss or other major damages.  <br/>
                    The purpose of ethical hacking is to improve the security of the network or <br/>
                    systems by fixing the vulnerabilities found during testing. Ethical hackers<br/>
                    may use the same methods and tools used by the malicious hackers but with <br/>
                    the permission of the authorized person for the purpose of improving the <br/>
                    security and defending the systems from attacks by malicious users.<br/><br/>
                    Ethical hackers are expected to report all the vulnerabilities and weakness <br/>
                    found during the process to the management.</h5>
